### Hello there
I'm currently studying Computer Science in Germany.  

In my free time I am either working on my Spacetraders SDK or on Spacetraders itself.  
When I am not busy with studying or Spacetraders, I like to write small-er applications in Python.  

Also I occasionally take pictures of the Universe through my telescope.
